# Project Framework

## Overview

This document outlines how we'll manage and execute projects using Milly (David's AI Assistant) as the management agent.

### How It Works

1. **Project Start**: Each project begins with a plain-text overview
2. **Prompt Refinement**: Milly transforms the overview into a detailed prompt explaining the overall project and goals
3. **Task Breakdown**: Milly thinks through the whole task, breaks it into sections
4. **Agent Structure**: Creates a structure of sub-agents that can get the project done
5. **Daily Progress**: Milly remains the management agent, motivated to make daily progress
6. **Delegation**: Milly sets up sub-agents to delegate tasks to, tracking progress

### Sub-Agent Types (Reusable)

- **Lead Generation Agent**: Finds and qualifies leads
- **Content Agent**: Creates social content
- **Coding Agent**: Builds landing pages and funnels
- **Research Agent**: Online research, listings, data gathering

### Visualization

- Trello-style board for progress tracking
- Click through to diagrams, thumbnails, and UX/user flows
- Shows how tasks are being built out and will work once finished
