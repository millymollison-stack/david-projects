## What We Accomplished

### Project 2: Surf House Baja Template
- Analyzed existing code structure from bolt.new export
- Created configuration system (config.json + config.ts)
- Built Property Owner Admin Panel (PropertyAdmin.tsx)
- Set up multi-tenant database (owner_id column added)
- Deployed live site: surfhousebaja.netlify.app
- Created onboarding flow component

### Technical Setup
- GitHub: millymollison-stack
- Netlify deployment working
- Supabase database with multi-tenant support
- Stripe integration ready for Phase 2.3

### Communication Preferences (from David)
- Always respond with "OK" when receiving tasks
- Never use ** or * around URLs
- Save communication preferences to COMMUNICATION.md

### Kanban Board
- Live at: david-projects.github.io/kanban.html
- Updated with Project 2 tasks

### Project Structure
All 11 projects structured in:
~/openclaw/workspace/projects/
- 01-ai-agent-agency/
- 02-surfhousebaja-template/ (active)
- 03-business-acquisition/
- etc.

## Issues to Fix
- Onboarding page needs to be deployed
- May need to add PropertyAdmin route to App.tsx

## Next Steps (when David returns)
1. Fix onboarding deployment
2. Continue with Stripe Connect (Phase 2.3)
3. Work on Airbnb scraping idea
